# DeepRL
Implementations of some of the most well known Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms, namely:
* Advantage Actor Critic (A2C), which make us of the Generaized Advantage Estimation procedure;
* Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO);
* Coming soon

## Advantage Actor Critic (A2C)
To test it with the OpenAI `gym CartPole-v1` environment run:
```
python3 src/a2c.py 
```
